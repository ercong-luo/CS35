THIS MESSAGE IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE PREVIOUS MESSAGES BECAUSE, IF YOU COMPLETE THE ENIGMA CIPHER, YOU NEED TO HAVE AN EXAMPLE WHICH WILL TEST THE FULL ROTATION OF THE ENIGMA MACHINE ROTORS.  BECAUSE EACH ROTOR HAS TWENTY-SIX POSITIONS, WE MUST SEE AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX CHARACTERS BEFORE BOTH ROTORS WILL RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS.  OF COURSE, THIS MESSAGE WILL SERVE AS A GOOD TEST OF OTHER CIPHERS AS WELL.  SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ELSE IN THE WAY OF TEXT TO INCLUDE, I THOUGHT I MIGHT MAKE USE OF SOME SELF-REFERENTIAL HUMOR BY HAVING THIS MESSAGE DISCUSS ITSELF.  ALTHOUGH THAT EFFORT HAS NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL, IT GAVE ME AN EXCUSE TO KEEP TYPING AND WE JUST REACHED THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THIS CASE IN THE ENGIMA MACHINE.
